We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack.

Amazon's Sponsored Products advertising business is one of the fastest growing areas in the company. Have you ever wondered what happens behind that “Sponsored” label you see in search results on Amazon? Hint: it involves a lot of interesting tech delivered by a great team.

The Sponsored Products Marketplace team optimizes the systems and ad placements to match demand with supply using a combination of data-driven product innovation, machine learning, big data analytics, and low latency/high-volume engineering. By the time organic search results are ready, we've processed all of the potential ads and determined which ones are going to be shown. We do that billions of times per day, resulting in millions of engagements with products that might otherwise not have been seen by shoppers.

The business and technical challenges are significant. Fortunately, we have a broad mandate to experiment and innovate, and a seemingly endless range of new opportunities to build a big, sustainable business that helps Amazon continuously innovate on behalf of all customers.
We're looking for customer-obsessed, innovative, professional data scientist who can help us take our products to the next level of functionality, quality and performance. We embrace leaders with a startup mentality — those who seek a disruptive yet clear mission and purpose, have an unambiguous owner's mindset, and are relentlessly obsessed with delivering amazing products. As a Sr. Data Scientist on our team, you will be responsible for building and managing modeling projects, identifying data requirements, and delivering methodology and tools that are statistically grounded around our advertiser facing products such as new targeting controls, ad sourcing techniques, automated optimization strategies, and advertiser-facing recommendations. You should have superb analytical, technical, business and communication skills to be able to work with business and technology leaders to define and prioritize key business questions, build data acquisition processes, data sets, statistical models and analyses that answer those questions. If this sounds like your sort of challenge, read on.

Characteristics indicative of success in this role:
·
Highly analytical: You solve problems in ways that can be backed up with verifiable data. You focus on driving processes, tools, and statistical methods which support rational decision-making.
·
Technically fearless: You aren't satisfied by performing 'as expected' and push the limits past conventional boundaries. Your dial goes to '11'.
·
Engaged by ambiguity: You're able to explore new problem spaces with unique constraints and non-obvious solutions.
·
Team obsessed individual contributor: You help grow your team members to achieve outstanding results. You've learned that big plans generally involve collaboration and great communications.
·
Quality obsessed: You recognize that professional engineers ship complete, tested software to avoid getting trapped in a sea of technical debt. You balance speed with quality.
·
Humbitious: You’re ambitious, yet humble. You recognize that there’s always opportunity for improvement. You use introspection and feedback from teammates and peers to raise the bar.

Quandl is a data platform used by over 650,000 people, including thousands of analysts from the world’s top hedge funds, asset managers and investment banks. Professionals use Quandl for our rich suite of databases and unrivaled data consumption experience.
A key part of our offering includes long-tail financial and economic data, so called “Alternative Data”; obscure, rare or esoteric datasets that would never be typically made available to Wall Street firms by traditional sources.
Well-known examples of Alternative Data include sentiment measures, real-time tracking of vehicles via GPS transponders, satellite monitoring of industrial facilities, and consumer insights gleaned from anonymized credit card transactions. These datasets are often considered “alternative” because they do not fall in the traditional categories of data used by the financial industry: stock prices, company fundamentals, options and futures, and so forth. Their importance in the financial markets is increasing rapidly as hedge funds and active asset managers are eager for data that offers predictive insights about the performance of individual companies, sectors, and the economy as a whole.
As the world’s leading provider of Alternative Data, we deliver innovative products that power some of the most successful firms on Wall Street. We welcome you to join us in our journey, as we continue to redefine the investment landscape.
The Role
Quandl is currently seeking an experienced Lead Quantitative Researcher to join our Alternative Data team. The individual in this position will report to our Head of Alternative Data Research. The successful candidate will be responsible for championing the delivery of alternative data products that will produce quantitatively measurable market insights.
Duties and Responsibilities
Collaborate with peers to onboard and evaluate a broad array of highly unique data
Leverage financial market expertise to develop new Alternative Data products, from concept to completion
Perform quantitative and fundamental analyses of new data products to assess their informational advantage
Create product collateral, such as web documentation, white papers, and presentations
Work closely with sales and marketing teams to bring new products to market
Interface directly with clients to answer technical questions about your products
Mentor and guide junior data scientists and data engineers
The Candidate
The ideal candidate is an excellent quantitative analyst and researcher with experience in the capital markets or financial services industry.
Qualifications:
7+ years experience in quantitative analysis in the capital markets or financial services industry
Highly experienced in financial analysis, statistics, and modelling
Demonstrated experience in exploratory data analysis/mining with large datasets
Proficient in Python or R
Working knowledge of Excel, SAS, SQL, or other similar tools
Experience with Databricks, Spark, Hadoop, Redshift, AWS and other big data and cloud technologies is a plus
Experience with NLP and ML/AI is a plus
Experience with product development/management is a plus
Passionate, intellectually curious, and able to excel in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics/Statistics, Finance, Computer Science, Engineering or related Field

Our Company Culture
Quandl was acquired by Nasdaq Inc. in Dec 2018. Post-acquisition, we continue to operate independently out of our 60+ person office in central Toronto, on our mission to build the world’s leading marketplace for financial, economic and alternative data.
Our small-company environment means that we are small enough for you to make a difference; at the same time, Nasdaq’s support and scale makes us big enough for your work to have a meaningful impact for our customers and the industry.
Benefits and Perks
We offer:
A competitive salary and incentives
Interesting and meaningful problems to work on
Colleagues who are smart, motivated, talented and a pleasure to work with
Health benefits for yourself and your family
Your choice of hardware, software and work setup
Flexible office hours and generous vacation policy

Those who traditionally don't have access to advice, capital or network -- we want to support that long tail.

Most founders don't live in Silicon Valley or have the pristine pedigree to get in front of the ""right"" people. For far too long, startups have played on a scarcity model.

This is limiting the potential of founders. We fundamentally believe that great founders and companies are everywhere. Where there are problems, opportunities exist. We want to empower those founders.

We are building ClearAngel to democratize access to advice, network and capital.

We do this by scaling access to the rest of the world:
Access to advice (knowledge, resources)
Access to network (intros, people, community)
Access to capital

The role of the Data Engineer is to collaborate on backend architecture and minimalistic data pipelines that enable features for the Clear Angels product and supporting processes. Your responsibilities will be a superset of a typical Data Engineer, as there are often experiments and uncertainty that require creative solutioning at the earliest stages.

Application Deadline: ongoing

What your day-to-day will look like:
You will own technical products end to end, from design and architecture to deployment and maintenance

Working closely with every member of the team, you will produce significant components of the ClearAngel code

Work closely with all functions of Clearbanc, ranging from core Engineering team to Data Science team to the marketing team

You be in constant communication with the team to understand what features of the platform need to be built out, and solve bug fixes when necessary

You will scope out business needs for ClearAngel, and action them with speed and accuracy and then execute on it yourself

You will run and participate in founder townhalls, communicating closely with early-stage entrepreneurs

When it comes to product and engineering on ClearAngel, buck stops with you. Coordinate, roll up your sleeves, do what's necessary to get the ball moving forward

You will thrive if you:
Have a desire to help founders. We take a strong founder first stance on this team

Are self sufficient when it comes to execution. Figure out how to solve problems and make things happen, not waiting for help or permission

On this team, we maximize learning. You will fail if you're not learning fast enough

Are comfortable working in a high growth, constantly changing environment

You are heavy bias towards action. Ability to solve problems end-to-end on their own. You will implement ideas and experiments on your own with minimal support

Have experience working in a senior software engineering role, you are an expert when it comes to coding and you're ready to roll up your sleeves to get the job done!

Have a strong business sense, you can foresee potential issues and solve them quickly

Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively across multiple teams

Strong interest in building businesses, ecommerce, fintech

Technical Requirements:
3+ years of experience working on a variety of different projects / stacks would be ideal

Experience working on remote teams

Able to architect and scale data integrations from third-party API docs independently without much support

Interested and able to prototype solutions that might not scale to 1,000,000 users but can get the job done while we derisk the business outcomes

Comfortable working in server and database environments that are changing constantly

Demonstrated experience with using third party solutions and external APIs to supercharge existing features

Comfortable in a fast pace, changing roadmap team building the plane after jumping off the cliff

Comfortable with relational databases and schemas involving time-series

Skills and interest in Python, SQL, Snowflake, Kubernetes

About the Company:
FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
$2.6B Annual Revenue
100+ Countries
2.0B+ Transactions per Year
8,500+ Employees
(as of December 31, 2019)
Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.

FLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:
Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista
Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!
Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872
S&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)
Our Vision
Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.
Our Mission
FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.

Our Strategy
FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:
More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.
More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:
Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.
Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.
For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.
More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging

Together we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:
Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;
Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and
Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.
Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.

Our Values
FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:
Innovation: Figure out a better way
Execution: Get it done quickly
Integrity: Do the right thing
People: We make the difference
Collaboration: Accomplish more together
These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”
Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.
We strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.
FLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:
Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.

Performance Modeling Software Engineer

The Role

What is Performance Modeling ? Performace modeling is at the key foundation of computer architecture research and development.
Contemporary SoCs (System on Chip) are so complex that architects cannot design systems based on intuition and simple models only.
Adequate performance evaluation methods are absolutely crucial to steer the research and development process in the right direction.
However, performance modeling is non-trivial as there are multiple aspects to performance evaluation, such as picking workloads, selecting an appropriate modeling or simulation approach, running the model and interpreting the results using meaningful metrics. Each of these aspects is equally important and a performance evaluation method that lacks in any of these crucial aspects may lead to inaccurate performance data and may drive design and implementation in a wrong direction.
We are developing a NBIO performance model with the most innovative technology and tools that will accurately simulate the behavior of the northbridge IO. We partner with architects, other SoC modeling teams and performance verification team to ensure the accuracy of our model.

Candidates excited to seek the most sophisticated and exciting challenges in the computing industry are encouraged to apply. We are passionate about performance innovation. Think you can help us develop simulators to explore IO microarchitecture advancements for and project performance of complex IO and server workloads?

The Person
Will have an interest in Computer Archtitecture and Software. Can work in a global team environment and enjoys learning.

Propose solutions to improve and enhance performance using an intimate understanding of design architecture. Develop tools and methodologies for performance analysis of IO workloads.
Collaborate in micro-benchmarking, workload characterization, competitive analysis, bottleneck identification, and optimization. Communicate, propose, and implement solutions to IO performance issues.


Preferred Experience
Performance modeling/analysis of computer systems
Deep knowledge and strong hands-on experience with benchmarking, workload analysis.
Excellent programming with C++ or Java and Python are required
Background in computer architecture preferred
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and techniques
Software integration and debugging

When you apply to this selection process, you are not applying for a specific job, but to an inventory for future vacancies. As positions become available, applicants who meet the qualifications may be contacted for further assessment.
The inventory will be used to staff vacancies with various tenures including temporary (casual or part-time worker) and term (including acting appointments) and permanent (indeterminate). Under certain conditions, candidates appointed to a casual or term position may subsequently be appointed indeterminately to the same position. As various positions will be filled from this inventory, a complete statement of merit criteria is not provided at this time. The criteria listed are those requirements to be met for entry into the inventory. Should you be contacted for further consideration, the hiring manager will provide a copy of the complete Statement of Merit Criteria for the position being filled. At that time, you may be required to provide additional information to be used for screening and assessment. The merit criteria may be assessed each time using a variety of assessment methods in accordance with the position requirements.

Wikimedia is looking for an experienced and collaborative Product Manager to join our Product team while working closely with our analytics engineering team, data engineering team, and numerous other teams at Wikimedia to strengthen our data and analytics products.

Wikipedia is one of the largest internet properties in the world, visited by 1 billion people a month across 280 different languages. Our properties and API's generate a huge amount of data that we process through our custom-built open-source stack. We use this data to inform our strategy, make specific product decisions, inform academic research, and, increasingly, plug this directly into the product itself.

Due to our scale, our commitment to opensource, our desire to share our data with academics, and our strict privacy restrictions, this is no easy task. In fact, today, core capabilities like A/B testing, funnel analysis, and metrics like user retention are not readily available to our teams.

You will work with experienced teams of data engineers, data scientists, analysts, and product managers to set and execute a strategy and roadmap for improving our end-to-end data infrastructure to make collecting data, processing it and using it to make decisions as efficient as possible. In doing so, you will learn from and partner with stakeholders across data science, research, design and product as well as academics and Wikimedia volunteers.

You are responsible for:
Partner closely with data leaders across the organization to help define and set a coordinated data strategy across the organization
Ideate and develop data products and experiences that enable data scientists, analysts, product managers, and lay people to discover and consume information about Wikipedia.
Collaborate closely with product and engineering teams to handle new requests, prioritize work, communicate progress, and ensure that we deliver impactful work that aligns with our strategic priorities.
Understand the needs of users in order to prioritize new features
Balance privacy concerns against the value of the insights your team enables.
Del iver iterative products that drive incremental value and enable quick feedback from stakeholders wherever feasible
Use both qualitative and quantitative methods to measure the impact of your work
Work to expand global access to free knowledge!

Skills and Experience:
2+ years of experience designing and building data products that span across data analytics, data flows, etc. as a product manager or equivalent role
Proven track-record implementing complex data systems leveraging supporting data analysis, reasoning, and optimization as part of the decision making process
Expertise in data handling approaches and technologies with good understanding of system development lifecycles and modern data architectures (Data Lakes, Data Warehouse)
Experience working with structured and unstructured data
Understanding of data governance, data modeling, data pipelines, and data infrastructure
Familiarity working in an agile software development environment
Capability to work within cross-functional teams to drive results
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills with the ability to translate complex technical requirements
Bachelor's degree or equivalent in relevant work experience

Qualities that are important to us:
Problem-solver
Passionate about data and how it can be leveraged to drive data-driven decisions

Additionally, we'd love it if you have:
Background in software development, engineering, data science or analytics
Experience working with microservice architectures
Experience with open-source technology
Experience interacting with free and open-source software projects and communities
Experience editing Wikipedia or contributing to other wiki projects

About the Company:
FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
$2.6B Annual Revenue
100+ Countries
2.0B+ Transactions per Year
8,500+ Employees
(as of December 31, 2019)
Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.

FLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:
Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista
Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!
Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872
S&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)
Our Vision
Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.
Our Mission
FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.

Our Strategy
FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:
More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.
More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:
Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.
Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.
For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.
More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging

Together we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:
Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;
Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and
Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.
Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.

Our Values
FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:
Innovation: Figure out a better way
Execution: Get it done quickly
Integrity: Do the right thing
People: We make the difference
Collaboration: Accomplish more together
These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”
Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.
We strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.

Continuously investigate performance datasets, benchmarking them against expected performance, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

We want your help building a brand-new team whose mission is to use our wealth of data to make CircleCI better for each and every one of those developers! Our new Data Intelligence team will be the first CircleCI team to use machine learning to power features within our customer-facing application.

We're in search of experienced engineers who will join this growing team and help define this new space. Take the rare opportunity to be a key part of discovery, research, and development within a brand-new domain at CircleCI and craft a space that will play a key role in defining the future of our product.
About Our Team

We haven't built it yet, and we'd like you to help! Product engineering teams at CircleCI are staffed with around 7-8 engineers, a dedicated engineering manager, and other members like product managers, data scientists and analysts, designers, and user researchers. You'll be a part of the hiring and staffing process for this team - from working with engineering leadership on establishing skillset needs, to interviewing candidates, to onboarding new teammates.

You'll also have the opportunity to interact and collaborate with teams across our product and platform engineering organisation. Teams like our core engineering group, our data science and infrastructure teams, and our growth engineering teams, helping our customers engage with our platform at every step of the way.

What you'll do:
Collaborate with your peers to spec out, build, and test new features, simplify existing services, and scale our systems particularly in the areas of API development for data- and machine learning-focused features. This includes frequent pair programming.

Support, maintain and debug microservices in a scalable, distributed system.

Partner closely with product managers, designers, data analysts, and business partners to learn about our business priorities, explore solutions, weigh in on tradeoffs, and help set the strategic direction of our product.

What we're looking for:
You have 3+ years of experience building, testing, deploying, and debugging distributed systems in production environments, ideally with some experience in machine learning or closely related specialties
You've built distributed services for scale, with testing, instrumentation, and observability built into the fabric of your work.
You're willing to pick up new technologies and languages ( find our entire tech stack here ), and aren't afraid to admit what you don't know.
You're a strong, empathetic and flexible communicator. You flourish while collaborating with your team and its key partners. And you can effectively balance technical tradeoffs with delivering customer value quickly and iteratively.
You approach problems with curiosity and an open mind.
You write code that's easily readable, testable, maintainable and observable. And you feel a sense of ownership and accountability for the features you build.
